# Lockbit3.0_Archive

Archive page of the leak site after the Lockbit3.0 takedown by law enforcement.

# Important notes.
Some pages are inaccessible, but this is to be expected.  
As soon as all law enforcement information releases to the seized leaked sites have been completed, they will be quickly made accessible by the archive site administrators.
